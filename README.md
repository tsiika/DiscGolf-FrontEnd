# DiscGolf-FrontEnd
Front End side of unnamed disc golf app (name will be changed in time!)

# About
This project is part of full-stack developer course by Opiframe Oy. During this course students are creating their own projects and this is ours!

Idea for this app is to follow disc golfers as they play the game. 

We decided to separate front-end and back-end to separate repositories. With this it's easier to examine the source code as their own instances:

- [**Server-side source code can be found here:**](https://github.com/svihila/DiscGolf-API)

- [**Front-End source code of this project:**](https://github.com/tsiika/DiscGolf-FrontEnd)

- [**Legacy code of horizontal slice:**](https://github.com/tsiika/DiscGolf-FrontEnd/tree/legacy)

# Stages of development

In the first stage the page layout is built to look and feel functional. Information will be static at this point of developement. As we proceed with the project the functionality will come with it piece by piece. 

On second stage React will be implemented to project. 

Third stage of project is to get React talk to back-end.
